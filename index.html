        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p> I have worked in the restaurant field for 9 years in Finland from 2009 to 2018. I changed my field to a vehicle technician in 2017. I graduated as a vehicle technician in January 2020. I started applying for jobs in my new field, but due to Covid-19 I have not been able to find a job yet. Though I have done three internships. Two in Helsinki, Finland and one in London, England </p><br>

        <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
        <p>Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, I started studying coding on my own. I really liked it. But it is totally a new field for me that is why I am trying my best to consume this new field. And I am really lucky that I got the opportunity to be a part of a codecamp. This initiative of <a href="www.stackademic.com" target= "_blank">StackademicHQ</a> has been started by <a href="www.sunilsandhu.com" target="_blank">Sunil Sandhu</a>. I am really enjoying the way he has been teaching us. He literally has a differnt approach to coding world. And I'm lovin' it. </p><br>
